Text-based Python combat game built while learning programming.


## Attack on Titan – Text-Based Combat Prototype

This is a small text-based Python game I built while learning programming.
It focuses on character selection, stats management, and turn-based combat.

### Features
- Multiple playable characters
- Status bars (health, stamina, endurance)
- Randomized combat system
- Weapon durability
- Wave-based encounters

### What I practiced
- Python dictionaries
- Game loops and state management
- Functions and reusable logic
- Input handling
